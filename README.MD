# redapy - redacted.ch python API wrapper

very much in progress

## requirements
- poetry
- requests
- python-dotenv
- python 3.9 and higher

## progress tracker
https://brr.tf/redapytracker

## how to use
i've published this package to pypi under the name of redapy. so regular ```pip install redapy``` should work

take into consideration that this is still not a finished project that i develop in spare time so if you've found any bugs or just have some feedback feel free to open an issue and i'll take a look at it asap.
documentation is very barebones for now
